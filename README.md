# Professional Portfolio

Use HTML and CSS to develop a professional portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs. 

## Requirements

* When the portfolio is loaded the user is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. 

* When the navigation links are clicked the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. 

* When the "work" tab is clicked the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications. 

* When the application images are clicked the user is taken to the deployed application. 

* The first application image should be larger in size than the other application images. 

* When the portfolio application is resized or viewed on various screens and devices the user is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the Viewport Grading Requirements.
